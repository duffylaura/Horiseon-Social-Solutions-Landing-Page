# Landing page for Horiseon Social Solutions Services

## Description

The coder was hired by a marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solutions Services, to refactor and exisiting site to make it more accessible. This helped solved their problem of ensuring that their website is accessible by all. Web accessibility is essential both for providing access to those with disabilities as well as for protecting the company from potential litigation. Accessible sites also have better SEO. 

The coder made the following changes to the project: 
- Restructured the HTML code by segementing it into appropriate semantic elements. 
- Ordered these elements, including headings, to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
- Wrote in alt attributes for all images 
- Re-wrote the title element so taht it was an appropriate, concise title

- Restructured the CSS code by creating new classes and ids that allowed for the consolidation of code
- Deleted extraneous code

Additionally, the coder also began to contribue to the responsive web design (RWD) of this page. RWD will increase accessibiliy, such as by allowing users to view the website in a meaningfully-styled way on any size viewport. As of 9/23/22, this feature has not yet been perfected but can be demo-ed.
